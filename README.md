## âœ¨ Currently working on
I am currently working on an open source template for Glitch that allows Roblox developers to securely and effectively host their own group ranking bots for __free__ ðŸ˜Ž
I have seen so many Glitch projects that attempt to do this and are not secure at all *(not storing roblo security in .env files)*
